# Design and maintenance

## Runtime chain

```text
make run
  -> run.sh
  -> Docker Compose
  -> tini -> start-sim.sh
  -> Gazebo world + BlueBoat + wave/hydrodynamics plugins
  -> ArduPilot Rover SITL (JSON backend)
  -> MAVProxy -> QGC 14550 and student API 14551
```

`run.sh` owns host concerns: Docker access, UID/GID mapping, image selection,
GPU selection, display validation, and a temporary Xauthority file.
`start-sim.sh` owns container process order, logs, readiness, and shutdown.

## Reproducible sources

The Docker build pins and verifies:

| Source | Revision |
|---|---|
| ArduPilot Rover 4.7.0 | `1511f27194f1dcc3728270883047bdf022b3fd53` |
| ArduPilot Gazebo | `082a0fe231f6e63bc8d1598f1cba461d9e2ea7f5` |
| ArduPilot SITL Models | `25bc38ed8c6c0345840159a8cbc0b02781d52f3c` |
| ASV Wave Sim | `ca8629df4e191235753dfae92ef725d30b923364` |

Do not replace these with a floating branch. For an upgrade, resolve a complete
SHA, update both `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml`, rebuild without cache, reset
SITL parameters once, and repeat the full smoke test.

## Environment interface

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WORLD` | `blueboat_waves.sdf` | World available through Gazebo's resource path; also supports `blueboat_calm.sdf` and `blueboat_harbor.sdf` |
| `MAVLINK_QGC` | `udp:127.0.0.1:14550` | Host QGroundControl output |
| `MAVLINK_API` | `udp:127.0.0.1:14551` | Independent student/test output |
| `SOFTWARE_RENDERING` | `0` | Use Mesa CPU rendering when set to `1` |
| `WIPE_PARAMS` | `0` | Reset virtual EEPROM when set to `1` |
| `GAZEBO_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` | `90` | Gazebo/BlueBoat readiness deadline |
| `SIM_IMAGE` | `ardupilot-blueboat:4.7.0` | Local Docker image tag |

## Water profiles

Both worlds instantiate the same WavesModel system. The mild world uses a
single 0.08 m, 3 s sinusoid. The calm world uses zero amplitude. Keeping the
wavefield present in both worlds is essential: BlueBoat's hydrodynamics system
looks up the wavefield to calculate buoyancy and drag.

## Health versus acceptance

The Compose healthcheck proves Gazebo, ArduRover, and MAVProxy processes exist
and that a world-clock message can be received. It does not prove navigation.
`make smoke` is the semantic acceptance test for controller identity, parameter
configuration, movement, Hold, RTL, and disarm.

## Deferred work

Do not add ROS 2 or competition-specific behavior to this baseline incidentally.
Future AIMM work should add a separate autonomy layer and course assets while
preserving this known-good ArduPilot/Gazebo foundation.
